v0.7
----

- Change name of `model` script to `psamm-model`.
- native: Add YAML format for flux limits. The documentation has been updated
  to include more information on this format. This changes the `limits` key in
  `model.yaml` to a list of dicts.
- Add `--exchange` option to the `randomsparse` command to find random
  minimal sets of exchange reactions.
- Change name of `fluxconsistency` command to `fluxcheck`.
- Allow compounds to be marked as zero-mass (e.g. photons) by setting
  `zeromass: yes`. These compounds will be exempt from the mass requirements
  in the `masscheck` command.
- sbml: Provide access to model ID and name.
- sbml: Add option to skip boundary condition species when parsing.
- massconsistency: Fix bugs occurring when zero-mass compounds are specified.
- command: Log number of consistent reactions in `masscheck`.
- sbml: Fix a number of minor bugs.
- command: Fix search command when no alternative compound names are present

v0.6.1
------

- sbml: Fix bug where boundary conditions were parsed incorrectly.

v0.6
----

- Apply changes to the SBML parser in order for it to interoperate with
  `model-import`. This makes it easier to implement the SBML importer in
  `model-import`.
- Add non-strict mode to the SBML parser. This makes it possible to load
  almost-compliant SBML documents that are accepted by COBRA.
- `masscheck` command: Allow reactions to be marked as checked.
- cplex: Consider status `optimal_tolerance` to be successful.
- docs: Expand documentation on the `masscheck` command.
- docs: Change order of API documentation to `bysource`.

v0.5
----

- Add `sbmlexport` command to export current model as an SBML file.
- Add a generic interface to the linear programming solvers that delegates to
  an actual solver that is installed and has the required features. This adds
  a `--solver` option to a number of command which can be used to influence
  which solver is selected.
- Add `--epsilon` option to a number of commands that previously had the
  epsilon value hardcoded.
- Refactor functions in `fastcore` for easier use.
- docs: Extend docstring documentation of various modules.
- docs: Add DOI links for references.

v0.4
----

- Add documentation generated by Sphinx. The main contents of the
  [README](README.md) file has been moved to the new documentation.
- Generate the entry-point script using `setup.py`. This ensures that the
  package is correctly installed before the main script can be called. This
  also changes the name of the entry-point from `model.py` to `model`.
- Refactor functions in `massconsistency` for easier use.
- Add `__version__` attribute to main module.
- docs: Move references to separate section.
- docs: Fix file format documentation for medium file.
- Unit tests: Skip tests requiring a linear programming solver if Cplex is
  present.

v0.3
----

- Require reaction files to be explicitly listed in `model.yaml`.
- Add support for TSV reaction file format.
- Change format of YAML reactions (see [README](README.md) for details).
- Add tables of recognized compounds and reaction properties to
  [README](README.md).
- `masscheck` command: Automatically exclude biomass reaction from check.

v0.2
----

- Allow compounds to be specified using YAML, TSV or ModelSEED format. This
  changes the format of the `compounds` key in `model.yaml` (see
  [README](README.md) for more information).
- Allow specifying biomass reaction in `model.yaml` using the `biomass` key.
  The biomass reaction will be used by default for FBA, FVA, etc.
- Allow explicit definition of media. This can be defined using a table format
  or YAML format. See [README](README.md) for more information.
- `chargecheck`/`formulacheck` commands: Only check reactions where all
  compounds have charge/formula specified. The number of skipped reactions is
  reported separately.
- `chargecheck` command: Use charge information from model definition instead
  of requiring a separate charge table file.

v0.1
----

- Initial release.
